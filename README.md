# Sudoku Solver

## About

- This project implements a Sudoku solver and validator API built with HTML, CSS, Node, Express, and Chai. It provides endpoints to solve and validate Sudoku puzzles, supporting operations such as checking cell placements and solving puzzles programmatically using backtracking. It is built to test my front-end, back-end, and especially testing skills thoroughly.
